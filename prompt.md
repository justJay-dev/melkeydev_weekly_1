TODO: Simple counting program.

***** Feel free to get creative with this. ******

1.
    ask the user if they want to start counting (only once)
    do something if they fail yes/no
        
2.
    ask what they want to count to (a whole number)
    do something if they fail this
    
3.
    counting output must be controlled by user input
    example +1 every time they hit the enter key

4. 
    ask if they want to count to (X) more than once
        This is optional
